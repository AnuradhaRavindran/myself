um of digits:
int number = 345;
3 + 4 + 5 = 12
// frame a generic condition
whwnever the quotinet becomes 0, stop executing
while (quotient not equalto  0){
Logic:
345/10 --> quotient = 34 (int)
       --> remainder = 5 ( store)
34/10 --> quotient = 3
      --> remainder = 4 ( store)
3/10  --> quotient = 0
      --> remainder = 3  ( store)
         3%10  ( num < den) --> num is returned as remainder
}
