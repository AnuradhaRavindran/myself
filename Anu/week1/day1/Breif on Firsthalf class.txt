Why JAVA:
	*Simple
	*Secure
	*Platform Indipendent(WORA)
	*Robust etc,


Technical Reasons:
	*Huge community support
	*Easy Knowledge
	*More frameowrks 

=>WORA(write Once Run Anywhere)


=>How much of java is required
	*Class & Objects
	*Data Types & Variables
	*Keyword & Operators
	*Access Modifiers
	*Methods
	=>Controle Statements
	*Looping(for,while,do while,for each)
	*Select Statments(if,if else, switch)
	*Arrays
	*Strings
	*Regular Expressions
	*Collections
	*Constructor
	*this,static
	*OOPS(Inharitance,abstraction,encapsulation, polymorphism)
	*Exception handeling
	*Debugging

How to Print:

SHORTCUTS:
	*for formate ==> ctr+shift+f
	*to run code => ctrl+f11
	*sysout ==> syso+space
