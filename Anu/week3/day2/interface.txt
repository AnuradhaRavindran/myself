5. The implementation class can have its own method in it too.
6. Object instantiation cannot be done for an Interface.
   ( Blank resume template)
7. CLASS LEVEL MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IS NOT POSSIBLE
   INTERFACE LEVEL MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IS POSSIBLE

8. Inheritence - extends
   A class can inherit and also implement, both at a time.
