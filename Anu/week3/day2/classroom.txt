1.Design an Interface TaxCalculation with unimplemented methods below:
  Include documentations for each method
        void calcDeductions(String name, double HRA, double LTA)
    void calcGrossIncome(String name, double netIncome, double deductions)
    public int taxSlab()
    public double CalcTaxandPublishValue()
2. Design a second Interface IncomeCalculation with unimplemented method below:
       public double calcNetIncome(String name, double income1, double income2)
3. Implementation class: 
       CalcIndividualsTax, CalcBusinessTax  
       Implement TaxCalculation and IncomeCalculation interfaces
       Add its own method in this class( which is not in the interface)
4. Create a new class Execution class: ( with main method)
       Try to implement all the above learnings ( from point 1 to point 9)
